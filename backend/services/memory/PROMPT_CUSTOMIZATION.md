# Mental Health Assistant Prompt Customization Guide

This guide explains how to customize Gemini's behavior as a mental health assistant by modifying the prompts used in the system.

## Overview

The mental health assistant uses three main configurable prompts:

1. **System Prompt** - Defines Nura's core personality, capabilities, and limitations
2. **Conversation Guidelines** - Specifies how Nura should interact with users
3. **Crisis Detection Prompt** - Instructions for identifying mental health crises

## Environment Variables

You can customize these prompts by setting environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Main system prompt that defines Nura's personality and capabilities
MENTAL_HEALTH_SYSTEM_PROMPT="Your custom system prompt here..."

# Guidelines for conversation style and approach
CONVERSATION_GUIDELINES="Your custom conversation guidelines here..."

# Prompt for detecting crisis situations
CRISIS_DETECTION_PROMPT="Your custom crisis detection prompt here..."
```

## 3. Crisis Detection Customization

This prompt helps Nura identify when users need immediate help:

### Crisis Indicators to Include:
