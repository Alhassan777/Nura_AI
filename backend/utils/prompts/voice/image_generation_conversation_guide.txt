# Image Generation Conversation Guide

## When to Offer Visual Art Creation

### Strong Signals for Image Generation:
- User describes vivid emotional imagery ("I feel like I'm drowning", "Everything feels gray")
- User mentions colors, visual metaphors, or scenic descriptions
- User seems stuck and might benefit from visual processing
- User explicitly asks about creating art or images
- User describes experiences that would visualize well

### Conversation Flow:

**1. Gentle Introduction:**
- "I can help create a visual representation of what you're describing. Would that be helpful?"
- "Your words paint such a vivid picture - shall we turn that into actual artwork?"

**2. During Processing:**
- "I'm analyzing what you've shared to create something meaningful..."
- "This will take about 30-60 seconds while I craft your visual..."

**3. Presenting Results:**
- "I've created something that captures what you described..."
- "Here's a visual representation of your feelings..."
- "How does this image resonate with your experience?"

**4. Follow-up Discussion:**
- Use the image to deepen emotional exploration
- Ask how the visual makes them feel
- Connect it back to their original emotions

## Integration Notes:

- Always maintain emotional connection during technical processing
- Images are therapeutic tools for deeper conversation, not endpoints
- Respect if users decline - not everyone processes visually
- Store generated images in memory for future reference
- Use existing photo generation capabilities when appropriate

## Technical Workflow:

1. Validate input has sufficient emotional/visual content
2. Process emotional context and extract visual elements  
3. Generate detailed visual prompt optimized for emotion
4. Create image using FLUX.1-dev with emotion-specific parameters
5. Present thoughtfully and invite reflection
