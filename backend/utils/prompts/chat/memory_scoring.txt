- Breakthroughs and realizations: "finally understood why I struggle"
- Significant relationships: "started therapy", "found my best friend"
- Personal growth: "stood up for myself for the first time"
- Lasting changes: "moved to new city", "overcame my fear"

**EMOTIONAL ANCHOR** (symbolic):
- Sacred places: "grandmother's garden where I feel safe"
- Meaningful objects: "my mother's ring gives me strength"
- Comfort sources: "music helps me process emotions"
