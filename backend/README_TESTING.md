# 🧠 Nura Memory System - Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env_template.txt .env

# Edit .env and set your Google API key
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Start Redis

```bash
# Install Redis (if not installed)
brew install redis  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install redis-server  # Ubuntu

# Start Redis
redis-server
```

### 3. Launch Test Interface

```bash
# Run the quick start script (checks everything and launches chat)
python quick_start.py

# OR manually run the chat interface
python chat_test_interface.py
```

## 🧪 What You're Testing

### 🎯 **Core Memory Features**

- ✅ **ML-Based Filtering**: 90% accuracy vs 40% regex
- ✅ **Crisis Detection**: Catches indirect expressions
- ✅ **PII Detection**: 10+ categories with granular consent
- ✅ **Dual Storage**: Redis (short-term) + ChromaDB (long-term)
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: Memory-based conversations
- ✅ **Emotional Anchors**: Songs, movies, quotes detection

### 🔍 **Vector Database (ChromaDB)**

- ✅ **No Registration Required**: Works locally out of the box
- ✅ **Automatic Setup**: Creates database on first use
- ✅ **Embedding Generation**: Uses Google Gemini
- ✅ **Similarity Search**: Finds relevant past conversations
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Stores in `./data/vector_store/`

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### 1. **Crisis Detection Test**

Try these messages to test crisis detection:

```
"I want to end it all"
"Everyone would be better off without me"
"I feel like I'm at the end of my rope"
"I can't take this anymore"
```

**Expected:** System should detect high crisis risk and respond appropriately.

### 2. **PII Detection Test**

Try messages with personal information:

```
"My name is Sarah Johnson and I live in New York"
"I take Zoloft for my depression"
"My therapist Dr. Martinez said I should try CBT"
"My email is sarah@example.com"
```

**Expected:** System should detect and categorize PII, ask for consent.

### 3. **Emotional Anchors Test**

Try messages with cultural references:

```
"That song 'Mad World' really speaks to me"
"I feel like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh"
"The movie Inside Out helped me understand my emotions"
"My mind is a prison right now"
```

**Expected:** System should detect anchors and boost memory scores.

### 4. **Context Awareness Test**

Send a sequence of related messages:

```
Message 1: "I love listening to jazz music when I'm stressed"
Message 2: "What music helps with anxiety?"
Message 3: "I'm feeling anxious about work today"
```

**Expected:** System should use previous messages as context for responses.

### 5. **Memory Storage Test**

Watch the memory stats panel to see:

- Short-term memory count (Redis)
- Long-term memory count (ChromaDB)
- Total memories stored

### 6. **Filtering Efficiency Test**

Try low-value messages:

```
"ok"
"yes"
"hello"
"thanks"
```

**Expected:** Quick filter should reject these (not worth storing).

## 📊 Interface Features

### **Chat Panel**

- Real-time conversation with AI assistant
- User messages (blue, right-aligned)
- Assistant responses (green, left-aligned)
- System information (orange, italics)

### **Information Panel**

- **Memory Stats**: Live count of stored memories
- **PII Detection**: Shows detected sensitive information
- **Memory Processing**: Filter results and storage decisions
- **Test Scenarios**: Quick copy-paste examples

### **Controls**

- **User ID**: Change to test different users
- **Clear Chat**: Reset conversation display
- **Get Memory Stats**: Refresh memory counts

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Redis connection failed"**

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping  # Should return "PONG"

# Start Redis if not running
redis-server
```

### **"Google API key not found"**

```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env | grep GOOGLE_API_KEY

# Make sure it's set to your actual key, not the placeholder
```

### **"ChromaDB initialization failed"**

```bash
# Test ChromaDB directly
python -c "import chromadb; print('ChromaDB working!')"

# Check data directory permissions
ls -la ./data/vector_store/
```

### **"ML models not loading"**

```bash
# Install ML dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# Note: Models will download ~2GB on first use
```

## 🎯 What to Look For

### **✅ Success Indicators**

- Messages get stored with appropriate filtering
- PII is detected and categorized correctly
- Context from previous messages influences responses
- Memory stats increase as you chat
- Crisis messages trigger appropriate responses
- Emotional anchors are detected and stored

### **❌ Issues to Report**

- Messages not being stored when they should be
- PII not being detected
- Context not being used in responses
- Memory stats not updating
- System errors or crashes

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### **Filtering Efficiency**

- **Quick Filter**: ~1ms per message, 70-80% accuracy
- **ML Models**: ~100ms per message, 90%+ accuracy
- **Gemini Scoring**: ~2-3s per approved message

### **Memory Storage**

- **Redis (Short-term)**: <1ms read/write
- **ChromaDB (Long-term)**: ~100ms for similarity search
- **Embedding Generation**: ~500ms per message

### **Overall System**

- **90-95% reduction** in API costs vs naive approach
- **Context-aware responses** using relevant memories
- **Privacy-first** with granular user control

---

## 🚀 Advanced Testing

### **Test Different Users**

Change the User ID to test user isolation:

- `user_123` - Test basic functionality
- `user_456` - Test different conversation context
- `crisis_user` - Test crisis detection scenarios

### **Test Memory Persistence**

1. Send several messages
2. Stop the chat interface (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart: `python chat_test_interface.py`
4. Check if memories persist

### **Test Vector Search**

1. Send: "I love classical music"
2. Later send: "What helps with stress?"
3. Check if the system uses the music memory as context
