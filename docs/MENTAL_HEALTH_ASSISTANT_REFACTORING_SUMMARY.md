```
mental_health_assistant.py (1,770 lines)
├── Massive repetitive extraction patterns
├── Duplicate parsing methods
├── Repetitive opportunity analyzers
├── Large crisis intervention methods
└── Complex prompt loading logic
```

#### **After: Modular Architecture**

```

├── extractors/
│   ├── base_extractor.py           # Common extraction patterns
│   ├── schedule_extractor.py       # Schedule opportunity detection
│   ├── action_plan_extractor.py    # Action plan generation
│   └── __init__.py                 # Unified imports
└── crisis_intervention.py          # Dedicated crisis management
```

## 🔧 **Refactoring Details**

### **1. Base Extractor Pattern**

Created `BaseExtractor` and `BaseOpportunityAnalyzer` classes to eliminate repetitive code:

```python
class BaseExtractor:
    """Base class for all information extractors."""

    def __init__(self, model, config):
        self.model = model
        self.config = config

    async def extract_information(self, user_message, response_text, context, opportunity):
        # Unified extraction pattern

class BaseOpportunityAnalyzer:
    """Base class for analyzing opportunities to suggest features."""

    def analyze_opportunity(self, user_message, response_text, context):
        # Common analysis logic
```

### **2. Specialized Extractors**

#### **Schedule Extractor** (`schedule_extractor.py`)

- **Purpose**: Detects opportunities for wellness check-ins
- **Triggers**: Isolation mentions, therapy reminders, crisis follow-ups
- **Output**: Schedule suggestions with optimal timing

#### **Action Plan Extractor** (`action_plan_extractor.py`)

- **Purpose**: Generates structured action plans for goals
- **Types**: Therapeutic emotional goals, personal achievement goals
- **Output**: Step-by-step action plans with SMART goal methodology

### **3. Crisis Intervention Integration**

Maintained all crisis detection capabilities while improving organization:

- ✅ Real-time crisis assessment
- ✅ Emergency contact integration
- ✅ Automatic intervention triggering
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

### **4. Parallel Processing Implementation**

```python
async def _extract_all_metadata(self, user_message, response_text, context):
    """Extract all metadata using parallel processing."""

    # Run extractions concurrently for improved performance
    import asyncio

    metadata_task = self._extract_session_metadata(user_message, response_text)
    schedule_task = self.schedule_extractor.extract_information(...)
    action_plan_task = self.action_plan_extractor.extract_information(...)

    # Wait for all extractions to complete
    metadata, schedule_analysis, action_plan_analysis = await asyncio.gather(
        metadata_task, schedule_task, action_plan_task
    )
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**
